# OptiRoute
Repository to develop IV project

# Problem description
   A house cleaner needs to optimise her day in order to be as productive as possible and thus maximise her daily salary. She currently has three houses to clean and has new requests from clients. She doesn't own a car and only travels by public transport in the Granada metropolitan area. The aim is to determine the best plan for her day, including the ideal order of houses to clean, the best times and the most efficient routes, so that she can attend to as many houses as possible and thus make more money.

# Licence
 The licence that will be used for this project is MIT. I've never had contact with these terms, but in a search for licences to use, this was the one most recommended for those starting out due to its simplicity
